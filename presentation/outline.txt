    log out is supposed to invalidate the token, but doesn’t seem to

    also no visual indication of scope
    but maybe that’s because I’m already authorized
    and/or own the app?

Things that make this work:
    redirect-uri checking

# Enhancements

  - generate a random token, include as `state` in /authorize request

# Trade-offs

  - New sites learn more about you, because they can learn about everything
    you’ve ever done from the old site
  - Existing sites learn more about you, from knowing what other sites you
    sign in to
